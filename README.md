# Mom-s-Page

## Overview

This project is a personal page built for my mother, Rina.

Rina is a strong, beautiful woman who was born in Bangladesh and carries countless stories from her childhood in a vibrant and bountiful country. In pursuit of her dream to start a family in America, she immigrated to New York City with her husband. Together, they raised two sons and took on every burden they could if it meant giving us the opportunity to succeed.

Though the journey was not always easy, their sacrifices made it possible for me to grow up, learn, and pursue my ambitions in one of the most exciting cities in the world. I am endlessly proud of my parents and deeply grateful for the life they worked so hard to give us.

Now, I am using the coding skills I’ve begun developing in school to help my mom pursue the dreams she once had to put aside while supporting mine.

This page exists to share her story, help her stay connected, and allow those who believe in her journey to offer support.

## Purpose

The goal of this page is to:

- Share Rina’s story in a simple, welcoming way
- Provide easy access to her social and contact links
- Allow supporters to contribute toward her personal goals through tips or donations
- Make technology feel less intimidating

---

## How It Works

- Visitors can learn about Rina and her journey
- Social links allow people to stay in touch or reach out directly
- Optional tipping or support links allow patrons to contribute toward her goals

Everything is designed to be clean, minimal, and respectful.

## Future Vision

If this page proves successful in helping my mom raise money and build momentum toward her goals, I plan to expand this idea into a broader service.

The long-term vision is to create a platform that allows patrons to fund personal dreams or savings goals, with a focus on:

- Hardworking women
- Immigrants
- Individuals facing adversity

The goal is to keep technology simple, transparent, and empowering, while making everyday support more accessible.
