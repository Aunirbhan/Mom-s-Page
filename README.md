# Mom-s-Page

## Overview

This project is a personal page built for my mother, Rina. 

---

## Purpose

The goal of this page is to:

- Share Rina’s story in a simple, welcoming way
- Provide easy access to her social and contact links
- Allow supporters to contribute toward her personal goals through fundraising
- Mission to make technology less intimidating

---

## How It Works

- Visitors can learn about Rina and her journey
- Social links allow people to stay in touch or reach out directly
- Optional tipping or support links allow patrons to contribute toward her goals

Everything is designed to be clean, minimal, and respectful.

## Future Vision

If this page proves successful in helping my mom raise money and build momentum toward her goals, I plan to expand this idea into a broader service.

The long-term vision is to create a platform that allows patrons to fund personal dreams or savings goals, with a focus on:

- Hardworking women
- Immigrants
- Individuals facing adversity

The goal is to keep technology simple, transparent, and empowering, while making everyday support more accessible.
