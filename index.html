                <h2>Rina's Story</h2>
                <p>
                    This page was created for my mother, Rina—a strong and beautiful woman born in Bangladesh,
                    carrying countless stories from her childhood in a vibrant and bountiful country.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In pursuit of her dream to start a family in America, she immigrated to New York City with
                    her husband Debasish, where together they raised two sons Aurnab and Aunirbhan and took on every
                    burden they could if it
                    meant giving their sons the opportunity to succeed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Though the journey was never easy, their sacrifices allowed me to grow up, be educated, and
                    chase my ambitions in the best city in the world. I am endlessly proud of
                    my parents and deeply grateful for the life they worked so hard to build.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, I am using the coding skills I’ve begun developing in school to help my mom pursue the
                    dreams she once had to put aside while supporting mine. Help her fund her dreams through the links
                    above.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This page exists to share her story, help her stay connected, and allow those who believe in
                    her journey to offer support. Feel free to reach out.
                </p>
